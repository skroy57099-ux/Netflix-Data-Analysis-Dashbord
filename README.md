# Netflix-Data-Analysis-Dashbord
 This Tableau project analyzes Netflix content distribution, highlighting that Movies (68.42%) far outweigh TV Shows (31.58%). The platform's content is dominated by the TV-MA/TV-14 ratings and top genres are Documentaries and Stand-Up Comedy. The Total movies &amp; TV shows by years chart shows aggressive content expansion peaking around 2017-2018.
This Tableau project provides a detailed, interactive analysis of the Netflix content catalog, focusing on its composition, audience, and historical trends. The dashboard is designed with a sleek, dark theme to showcase data segmentation across four main visual components.
1. Movies & TV Shows Distribution (Pie Chart)
•	Analysis: This visualization immediately establishes the content ratio, showing that the platform is heavily dominated by Movies (68.42%, or 4,265 titles) compared to TV Shows (31.58%, or 1,969 titles).
•	Insight: Despite the global shift toward serialized viewing, Netflix's content foundation remains rooted in its vast movie library. This suggests that while TV shows drive sustained subscription and retention, the movie catalog is key to initial content volume and diversity.
2. Ratings (Bar Chart)
•	Analysis: This chart reveals the frequency of content by its maturity rating, and it is highly skewed toward adult audiences. The dominant ratings are:
o	TV-MA (2,027): For Mature Audiences (highest count).
o	TV-14 (1,698): Parents Strongly Cautioned (second highest).
•	Insight: The majority of Netflix's content investment targets adult viewers and teenagers, focusing on high-engagement genres like crime, drama, and thrillers. Content for younger or general audiences (G, TV-Y, etc.) represents a much smaller portion of the library.
3. Top 10 Genre (Bar Chart)
•	Analysis: This horizontal bar chart ranks the genres by title count, revealing the platform’s core content focus:
o	Documentaries (99): The most common genre, highlighting a major focus on non-fiction content.
o	Stand-Up Comedy (73): The second-most common, underscoring Netflix's strategy of exclusive short-form content.
o	The remaining top genres heavily feature International Movies and Dramas, confirming Netflix’s global production footprint.
•	Insight: Netflix differentiates its library by heavily prioritizing unique, high-value genres (Documentaries, Stand-Up Comedy) alongside aggressive investment in international productions, catering to a diverse, global, and mature audience base.
4. Total Movies & TV Shows by Years (Area Chart)
•	Analysis: This stacked area chart tracks the historical evolution of content added to the platform. There is minimal content before 2010, followed by a dramatic and sustained surge.
•	Insight: Content acquisition and production saw a massive escalation starting around 014, leading to a peak of content additions in 2016-2017 before slowing down slightly around 018. This period of aggressive expansion corresponds to Netflix's major global growth and shift toward original programming, indicating a proactive strategy to dominate the streaming market by rapidly increasing content volume.
5. Key Project Outcome Insights.
The integrated analysis suggests a deliberate content strategy built on three pillars: Scale, Maturity, and Globalization. Netflix has successfully leveraged a huge catalog of movies, focused its high-volume acquisitions on mature-rated content (TV-MA, TV-14), and committed heavily to international content and niche genres (Documentaries, Stand-Up Comedy) to maintain a competitive edge. The historical trend highlights that the era of peak content dumping may be over, shifting the strategic focus from volume to quality and targeted original production.
